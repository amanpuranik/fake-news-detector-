# fake-news-detector-
In this project, I use machine learning to try and see if a piece of news is fake or authentic based on its headline. The wording in fake news articles is often differs heavily from that of real news articles with things like spelling, bias, etc. I got the inspiration for this project because of how much fake news was being spread about COVID-19 during the pandemic. This fake news could be extremely misleading and potentially harmful. My goal was to make something that could help alleviate the panic in the world during difficult times like this.
